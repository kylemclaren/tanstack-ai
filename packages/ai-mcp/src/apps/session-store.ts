 * never reclaims a thread that is recorded but never has a widget interaction
 * (the common case — most threads never touch a `ui://` widget), so without the
 * sweep the map would grow by one entry per chat thread for the process
 * lifetime. The sweep drops every entry older than the TTL whenever a new one is
